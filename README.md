# Azure-MLOps
Join my Azure-MLOps journey! Exploring ML training, deployment, CI/CD, monitoring with Azure.


## Day 1: Introduction to Azure MLOps

- Spend 1 hour researching and familiarizing yourself with the concept of MLOps, its benefits, and its importance in machine learning model deployment and management.
- Spend 2 hours going through Microsoft's official documentation on Azure MLOps, including tutorials, guides, and best practices.

## Day 2-3: Azure Machine Learning Basics

- Spend 1 hour each Day learning the basics of Azure Machine Learning, including model training, deployment, and monitoring using Azure Machine Learning services.
- Spend 2 hours each Day experimenting with Azure Machine Learning Studio and Azure Machine Learning CLI, and following online tutorials to create and deploy simple machine learning models.

## Day 4-5: Azure DevOps Integration

- Spend 1 hour each Day learning how to integrate Azure MLOps with Azure DevOps for building end-to-end CI/CD pipelines for machine learning models.
- Spend 2 hours each Day setting up a sample project in Azure DevOps, configuring build and release pipelines, and deploying machine learning models using Azure DevOps.

## Day 6-7: Model Deployment and Monitoring

- Spend 1 hour each Day learning about advanced deployment techniques in Azure MLOps, such as deploying models as web services, Docker containers, and Kubernetes pods.
- Spend 2 hours each Day exploring monitoring and logging options in Azure MLOps, including Azure Monitor, Application Insights, and other monitoring tools for tracking the performance and health of deployed machine learning models.

## Day 8-9: Model Governance and Security

- Spend 1 hour each Day understanding the importance of model governance and security in MLOps, including considerations for data privacy, model explainability, and model versioning.
- Spend 2 hours each Day learning about Azure MLOps features for model governance and security, such as model versioning, model explanations, and model deployment policies.

## Day 10: Recap and Review

- Spend 3 hours reviewing and consolidating your learning from the previous Days, revisiting documentation, tutorials, and code examples to reinforce your understanding of Azure MLOps concepts and best practices.
- Spend additional time on areas that you feel need further clarification or practice, and seek help from online forums or communities if needed.
